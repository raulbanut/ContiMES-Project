# ContiMES-Project

We want to make an app for production to track our products, because we need them to be unique. The project is supposed to received data from an arduino and to check if exists in DB. If exist, the production should stop. If it doesn't exist, the production should continue and the data received will be added to the DB. 

### Conclusion

Our solution was the closest to the reality of the four presented, to demonstrate how it should work in a company production.
